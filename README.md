# myTrans-Master
This website was developed as part of my internship project. It is a fully functional and responsive website focused on providing resources, support, and visibility for the transgender community. Built using [mention tech stack like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.], it features a clean design, accessibility-friendly layout, and modern UI components.
